# Sprengenbeken ("spring brooks")

A few years ago, some people from the Bekenstichting and I made a knowledge clip about "sprengenbeken", a specific type of man-made brook found on the slopes of glacial push moraines in the Netherlands. 
In this video we explain (in Dutch) what makes these sprengenbeken special, how they were formed, where their water comes from and what is necessary to keep them.
